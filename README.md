EN.Tutor V0.1 Beta
The program contains the most common words in the English language, which represent more than 80% of the words used in daily conversations.

The program is very simple, where the word is pronounced and the user writes it, if the word is correct, it is added to the list of known words where it will not be repeated again, and if the word is wrong, it is added to the list of unknown words to be repeated again.

Working instructions are in the user interface.
